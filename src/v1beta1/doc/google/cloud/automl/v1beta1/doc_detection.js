 * Annotation details for video object tracking.

 *   present on a single example.
 *   NOTE: Instance ID prediction quality is not a part of model evaluation and
 *   is done as best effort. Especially in cases when an entity goes
 *   off-screen for a longer time (minutes), when it comes back it may be given
 *   a new instance ID.
 *
 * @property {Object} timeOffset
 *   Required. A time (frame) of a video to which this annotation pertains.
 *   Represented as the duration since the video's start.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Duration]{@link google.protobuf.Duration}
 *
 * @property {Object} boundingBox

 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BoundingPoly]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.BoundingPoly}
 *
 * @property {number} score
 *   Output only. The confidence that this annotation is positive for the video at
 *   the time_offset, value in [0, 1], higher means higher positivity
 *   confidence. For annotations created by the user the score is 1. When
 *   user approves an annotation, the original float score is kept (and not
 *   changed to 1).
