 *          in that time segment, if it is present in any part of it. The video
 *          ML model evaluations are done only for this type of classification.
 *
 *   *  `shot`- Shot-level classification.
 *          AutoML Video Intelligence determines the boundaries
 *          for each camera shot in the entire segment of the video that user
 *          specified in the request configuration. AutoML Video Intelligence
 *          then returns labels and their confidence scores for each detected
 *          shot, along with the start and end time of the shot.
 *          WARNING: Model evaluation is not done for this classification type,
 *          the quality of it depends on training data, but there are no
 *          metrics provided to describe that quality.
 *
 *   *  `1s_interval` - AutoML Video Intelligence returns labels and their
 *          confidence scores for each second of the entire segment of the video
 *          that user specified in the request configuration.
