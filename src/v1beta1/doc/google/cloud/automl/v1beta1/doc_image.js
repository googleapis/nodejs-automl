 * @property {string} baseModelId
 *   Optional. The ID of the `base` model. If it is specified, the new model
 *   will be created based on the `base` model. Otherwise, the new model will be
 *   created from scratch. The `base` model must be in the same
 *   `project` and `location` as the new model to create, and have the same
 *   `model_type`.
 *
 * @property {number} trainBudget
 *   Required. The train budget of creating this model, expressed in hours. The
 *   actual `train_cost` will be equal or less than this value.
 *
 * @property {number} trainCost
 *   Output only. The actual train cost of creating this model, expressed in
 *   hours. If this model is created from a `base` model, the train cost used
 *   to create the `base` model are not included.
 *
 * @property {string} stopReason
 *   Output only. The reason that this create model operation stopped,
 *   e.g. `BUDGET_REACHED`, `MODEL_CONVERGED`.
 *
 * @property {string} modelType
 *   Optional. Type of the model. The available values are:
 *   *   `cloud` - Model to be used via prediction calls to AutoML API.
 *                 This is the default value.
 *   *   `mobile-low-latency-1` - A model that, in addition to providing

 *                 AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile or edge device
 *                 with TensorFlow afterwards. Expected to have low latency, but
 *                 may have lower prediction quality than other models.
 *   *   `mobile-versatile-1` - A model that, in addition to providing
 *                 prediction via AutoML API, can also be exported (see
 *                 AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile or edge device
 *                 with TensorFlow afterwards.

 *                 latency, but should also have a higher prediction quality
 *                 than other models.
 *   *   `mobile-core-ml-low-latency-1` - A model that, in addition to providing
 *                 prediction via AutoML API, can also be exported (see
 *                 AutoMl.ExportModel) and used on a mobile device with Core
