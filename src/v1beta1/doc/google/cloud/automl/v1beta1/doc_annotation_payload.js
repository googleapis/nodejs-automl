 * Contains annotation information that is relevant to AutoML.
 *
 * @property {Object} translation
 *   Annotation details for translation.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TranslationAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.TranslationAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} classification
 *   Annotation details for content or image classification.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ClassificationAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.ClassificationAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} imageObjectDetection
 *   Annotation details for image object detection.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ImageObjectDetectionAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.ImageObjectDetectionAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} videoClassification
 *   Annotation details for video classification.
 *   Returned for Video Classification predictions.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [VideoClassificationAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.VideoClassificationAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} textExtraction
 *   Annotation details for text extraction.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TextExtractionAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.TextExtractionAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} textSentiment
 *   Annotation details for text sentiment.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TextSentimentAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.TextSentimentAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {Object} tables
 *   Annotation details for Tables.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TablesAnnotation]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.TablesAnnotation}
 *
 * @property {string} annotationSpecId
 *   Output only . The resource ID of the annotation spec that
 *   this annotation pertains to. The annotation spec comes from either an
 *   ancestor dataset, or the dataset that was used to train the model in use.
 *
 * @property {string} displayName
 *   Output only. The value of AnnotationSpec.display_name when the model
 *   was trained. Because this field returns a value at model training time,
 *   for different models trained using the same dataset, the returned value
 *   could be different as model owner could update the display_name between
 *   any two model training.
