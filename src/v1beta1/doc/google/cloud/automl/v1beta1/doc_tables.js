/**
 * Metadata for a dataset used for AutoML Tables.
 *
 * @property {string} primaryTableSpecId
 *   Output only. The table_spec_id of the primary table of this dataset.
 *
 * @property {string} targetColumnSpecId
 *   column_spec_id of the primary table's column that should be used as the
 *   training & prediction target.
 *   This column must be non-nullable and have one of following data types
 *   (otherwise model creation will error):
 *   * CATEGORY
 *   * ARRAY(CATEGORY)
 *   * FLOAT64
 *   Furthermore, if the type is CATEGORY or ARRAY(CATEGORY), then only up to
 *   40 unique values may exist in that column across all rows, but for
 *   ARRAY(CATEGORY) unique values are counted as elements of the ARRAY (i.e.
 *   following 3 ARRAY-s: [A, B], [A], [B] are counted as having 2 unique
 *   values).
 *
 *   NOTE: Updates of this field will instantly affect any other users
 *   concurrently working with the dataset.
 *
 * @property {string} weightColumnSpecId
 *   column_spec_id of the primary table's column that should be used as the
 *   weight column, i.e. the higher the value the more important the row will be
 *   during model training.
 *   Required type: FLOAT64.
 *   Allowed values: 0 to 10000, inclusive on both ends; 0 means the row is
 *                   ignored for training.
 *   If not set all rows are assumed to have equal weight of 1.
 *   NOTE: Updates of this field will instantly affect any other users
 *   concurrently working with the dataset.
 *
 * @property {string} mlUseColumnSpecId
 *   column_spec_id of the primary table column which specifies a possible ML
 *   use of the row, i.e. the column will be used to split the rows into TRAIN,
 *   VALIDATE and TEST sets.
 *   Required type: STRING.
 *   This column, if set, must either have all of `TRAIN`, `VALIDATE`, `TEST`
 *   among its values, or only have `TEST`, `UNASSIGNED` values. In the latter
 *   case the rows with `UNASSIGNED` value will be assigned by AutoML. Note
 *   that if a given ml use distribution makes it impossible to create a "good"
 *   model, that call will error describing the issue.
 *   If both this column_spec_id and primary table's time_column_spec_id are not
 *   set, then all rows are treated as `UNASSIGNED`.
 *   NOTE: Updates of this field will instantly affect any other users
 *   concurrently working with the dataset.
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, Object>} targetColumnCorrelations
 *   Output only. Correlations between
 *
 *   target_column,
 *   and other columns of the
 *
 *   primary_table.
 *   Only set if the target column is set. Mapping from other column spec id to
 *   its CorrelationStats with the target column.
 *   This field may be stale, see the stats_update_time field for
 *   for the timestamp at which these stats were last updated.
 *
 * @property {Object} statsUpdateTime
 *   The most recent timestamp when target_column_correlations field and all
 *   descendant ColumnSpec.data_stats and ColumnSpec.top_correlated_columns
 *   fields were last (re-)generated. Any changes that happened to the dataset
 *   afterwards are not reflected in these fields values. The regeneration
 *   happens in the background on a best effort basis.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}

 *
 * @property {string} optimizationObjective
 *   Objective function the model is optimizing towards. The training process
 *   creates a model that maximizes/minimizes the value of the objective
 *   function over the validation set.
 *
 *   The supported optimization objectives depend on the prediction_type.

 *
 * @property {number} trainBudgetMilliNodeHours
 *   The train budget of creating this model, expressed in milli node hours
 *   i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour.
 *
 *   The training cost of the model will not exceed this budget. The final cost
 *   will be attempted to be close to the budget, though may end up being (even)
 *   noticeably smaller - at the backend's discretion. This especially may
 *   happen when further model training ceases to provide any improvements.
 *
