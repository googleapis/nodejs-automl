/**
 * Indicated the type of data that can be stored in a structured data entity
 * (e.g. a table).
 *
 * @property {Object} listElementType
 *   If type_code == ARRAY,
 *   then `list_element_type` is the type of the elements.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [DataType]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.DataType}
 *
 * @property {Object} structType
 *   If type_code == STRUCT, then `struct_type`
 *   provides type information for the struct's fields.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [StructType]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.StructType}
 *
 * @property {string} timeFormat
 *   If type_code == TIMESTAMP
 *   then `time_format` provides the format in which that time field is
 *   expressed. The time_format must either be one of:
 *   * `UNIX_SECONDS`
 *   * `UNIX_MILLISECONDS`
 *   * `UNIX_MICROSECONDS`
 *   * `UNIX_NANOSECONDS`
 *   (for respectively number of seconds, milliseconds, microseconds and
 *   nanoseconds since start of the Unix epoch);
 *   or be written in `strftime` syntax. If time_format is not set, then the
 *   default format as described on the type_code is used.
 *
 * @property {number} typeCode
 *   Required. The TypeCode for this type.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [TypeCode]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.TypeCode}
 *
 * @property {boolean} nullable
 *   If true, this DataType can also be `null`.
