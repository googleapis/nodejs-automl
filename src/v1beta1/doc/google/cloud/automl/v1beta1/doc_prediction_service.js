 * Request message for PredictionService.Predict.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Name of the model requested to serve the prediction.
 *
 * @property {Object} payload
 *   Required.
 *   Payload to perform a prediction on. The payload must match the
 *   problem type that the model was trained to solve.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ExamplePayload]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.ExamplePayload}
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} params
 *   Additional domain-specific parameters, any string must be up to 25000
 *   characters long.
 *
 *   *  For Image Classification:
 *
 *      `score_threshold` - (float) A value from 0.0 to 1.0. When the model
 *       makes predictions for an image, it will only produce results that have
 *       at least this confidence score. The default is 0.5.
 *
 *    *  For Image Object Detection:
 *      `score_threshold` - (float) When Model detects objects on the image,
 *          it will only produce bounding boxes which have at least this
 *          confidence score. Value in 0 to 1 range, default is 0.5.
 *      `max_bounding_box_count` - (int64) No more than this number of bounding
 *          boxes will be returned in the response. Default is 100, the
 *          requested value may be limited by server.

/**
 * Response message for PredictionService.Predict.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} payload
 *   Prediction result.
 *   Translation and Text Sentiment will return precisely one payload.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [AnnotationPayload]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.AnnotationPayload}
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} metadata
 *   Additional domain-specific prediction response metadata.
 *
 *   * For Image Object Detection:
 *    `max_bounding_box_count` - (int64) At most that many bounding boxes per
 *        image could have been returned.
 *
 *   * For Text Sentiment:
 *    `sentiment_score` - (float, deprecated) A value between -1 and 1,
 *        -1 maps to least positive sentiment, while 1 maps to the most positive
 *        one and the higher the score, the more positive the sentiment in the
 *        document is. Yet these values are relative to the training data, so
 *        e.g. if all data was positive then -1 will be also positive (though
 *        the least).
 *        The sentiment_score shouldn't be confused with "score" or "magnitude"
 *        from the previous Natural Language Sentiment Analysis API.

/**
 * Request message for PredictionService.BatchPredict.
 *
 * @property {string} name

 *   Required. The input configuration for batch prediction.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BatchPredictInputConfig]{@link google.cloud.automl.v1beta1.BatchPredictInputConfig}
 *
 * @property {Object} outputConfig

 *
 * @property {Object.<string, string>} params

 *   be up to 25000 characters long.
 *
 *   *  For Video Classification :
 *      `score_threshold` - (float) A value from 0.0 to 1.0. When the model
 *          makes predictions for a video, it will only produce results that
 *          have at least this confidence score. The default is 0.5.
 *      `segment_classification` - (boolean) Set to true to request
 *          segment-level classification. AutoML Video Intelligence returns
 *          labels and their confidence scores for the entire segment of the
 *          video that user specified in the request configuration.
 *          The default is "true".
 *      `shot_classification` - (boolean) Set to true to request shot-level
 *          classification. AutoML Video Intelligence determines the boundaries
 *          for each camera shot in the entire segment of the video that user
 *          specified in the request configuration. AutoML Video Intelligence
 *          then returns labels and their confidence scores for each detected
 *          shot, along with the start and end time of the shot.
 *          WARNING: Model evaluation is not done for this classification type,
 *          the quality of it depends on training data, but there are no metrics
 *          provided to describe that quality. The default is "false".
 *      `1s_interval_classification` - (boolean) Set to true to request
 *          classification for a video at one-second intervals. AutoML Video
 *          Intelligence returns labels and their confidence scores for each
 *          second of the entire segment of the video that user specified in the
 *          request configuration.
